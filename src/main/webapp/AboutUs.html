You may not know this, but we've been around for an impressive six weeks! It all started on the date of July 34, 2024, when our visionary founder, John Doughnut, was enjoying a plain piece of dough.

In a moment of clumsy genius, John accidentally dropped the dough into a vat of sizzling oil. Ever the curious soul, he fished it out, took a bite, and BAM! History was made. But John wasn't done yet. To really spice things up, he slathered it with a bold choice: mustard. And you know what? It was… deliocious.

That’s when John had the greatest culinary breakthrough of all time: removing the middle entirely. That way, it can slide on a doughnut stick.

From that glorious (and slightly chaotic) moment, the doughnut was reborn. Sure, we've since traded the mustard for frosting and sprinkles, but the spirit of experimentation lives on in every hole-y creation we serve.
